### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building up my online presence!
- 🌱 I’m currently _relearning_ RoR, ReactJS
- 💬 Ask me about MeteorJS, VueJS, MongoDB, Product Development, Software Development Cycles and Processes
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with exiting vim
- 📫 How to reach me: Twitter! [@Jwnathan_W](https://twitter.com/Jwnathan_W)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: After spending 4+ years with a JS stack I've kind of missed Ruby and exploring other technologies - anyone have tips on relearning stuff from 3/4 years ago? 😅
